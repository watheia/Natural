# IMPORTANT UPDATE

After many years an awesome developer has finally decided to step up and share the burden of bringing this plugin to its next stages: thanks **[Aaron R. Miller](https://github.com/drkstr101)** for your contributions, but above all, thanks for your enthusiasm and for reinvigorating the project!

This doesn't mean we wouldn't appreciate your help so don't be shy and submit your contributions! If you are unable or unwilling to contribute your time, please consider a donation: we have opened a [Github Sponsors account][5].

##### Natural installation can be achieved by adding the `Natural Plugin Update Site` with `https://rlogiacco.github.com/Natural` as URL.
